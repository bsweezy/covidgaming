In this time of social distancing, what are gaming options for friends distributed in different houses? Obviously, if you're all gamers and already own multiplayer titles and setups, this is an easy question. For those of us who are casual gamers and still want to hang out with each other just not in person, what are our options? I'll be updating the list through regular blog-like posts. Scientific American is thinking about this as well, see [Could Video Games and Other Entertainment Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19?](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/could-video-games-and-other-entertainment-help-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19/).

Just began this website based on recommendations friends have been making.

## Traditional Multiplayer
These options require everyone to own a copy of the game and to run it independently using traditional in-game multiplayer connections. Think of these as traditional "LAN Party" options, but offered remotely. These are the most cost-intensive, but some of your friends may already own copies of some of these options. Others are available Steam on a free to play basis.
* [Crusader Kings](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Multiplayer) (free to play), including multiplayer single nation co-op
* free PC remake of [Goldeneye: Source](https://geshl2.com/) (multiplayer)
* free [Counterstrike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) on Steam
* single nation co-op [Europa Universalis 4](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Multiplayer)

  * Divinity: Original Sin 2
  * We Were There - *Super cool co-op atmospheric puzzle game. Basically you are both situated in a castle, but not together. One of you has to navigate the other person through puzzles and traps until you both meet each other. Free on steam.*
  * Portal 2
* Classic multiplayer games friends might already own
  * age of kings
* *Not a game suggestion but Steam now has **Remote Play Together**, where you can play games that are local only online with other Steam users. I tried it a few times and it's worked well. This should open up a few more options for the two of you.*

Using something like [Twitch.tv](https://www.howtogeek.com/183900/how-to-stream-a-pc-game-online-with-twitch-tv/) or [Steam Remote Play](https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay), these let a group discuss moves to make in the game while just one member needs to actually run the program.

## Physical Board Game w Video Streaming
Same as above, but with a videocamera/webcam from your laptop pointed at the physical game. Hard to manage when there is secret knowledge. You could host set up & stream any cooperative board game over any videostreaming platform.

## Generic Board Game Simulator/Online
From [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/fjqg5g/are_you_cancelling_your_game_nights/) Reddit thread:
* *For people with lower end computers that cant run TTS, there is [BoardGameArena.com](https://BoardGameArena.com) (experiencing issues)*
* *If you have ever wanted to give A Game of Thrones a try, checkout [ThroneMaster.net](https://ThroneMaster.net) (FFG is supposed to have an official digital version in 2020 maybe it will come out soon.)*
* *If you have wanted to try Diplomacy, now is your chance. [https://www.playdiplomacy.com/](https://www.playdiplomacy.com/)*
